This Docker Compose configuration sets up a complete environment with a reverse proxy (Traefik) and two applications (MySQL and Snipe-IT) running in containers. Traefik acts as the entry point, handling SSL termination and routing traffic to the respective applications based on defined rules and labels. 

Additionally, it demonstrates how to use Traefik along with SSL certificate generation using Let's Encrypt solely through Docker Compose and Docker labels. This setup can be useful for projects where you need to deploy multiple services and want to have a centralized entry point (reverse proxy) for handling traffic and SSL termination.

By using this example, you can quickly deploy the Snipe-IT application with proper SSL configuration, allowing secure access to the application over HTTPS. The Traefik dashboard is also accessible, providing you with insights into the routing and configuration.

Remember to adjust any domain names, email addresses, or other settings according to your specific needs. Overall, this Docker Compose configuration offers a practical and functional solution for deploying Snipe-IT with Traefik and SSL in a containerized environment.
